## Features

### Design Features
Each page of the website features a consistent responsive navigational system:
- The **Header** contains a conventionally placed **logo** in the top left of the page (whereby by clicking this will redirect users back to the home page) and **navigation bar** in the top right of the page.
- The **Footer** contains the appropriate **social media icons**, linking users to the three main social media pages of Kryan.

<dl>
  <dt><a href="index.html" target="_blank">Home Page</a></dt>
  <dd>The Home Page is divided two columns wide on desktops and one column wide on mobile and tablet devices:
     <ul>
          <li><strong>Hero Image</strong> - Occupying 50% of the page width, on the left side, while viewing on a desktop. On mobile and tablet devices, the image becomes stacked at the top of the page, occupying 100% of the page width. The imagery used was specifically chosen as it created a impactful first impression, setting the tone of the website for the user.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Banner Container</strong> - Occupying 50% of the width, on the right side, while viewing on a desktop. On mobile and tablet devices, the container becomes stacked, underneath the <strong>Hero Image</strong>. The purpose of the container is to provide an area in the center to highlight the latest release from the artist. This style was chosen in order to draw the users attention to the information straight away. In this, there is a <strong>call to action</strong> button linking to the external page where users can select their preferred platform to listen to the latest release.
          </li>
     </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="bio.html" target="_blank">Bio Page</a></dt>
  <dd>The Bio Page is divided similarly to the Home Page in order to create a consistent look throughout. Just like the Home page, the Bio page is two columns wide on desktops and one column wide on mobile and tablet devices:
     <ul>
          <li><strong>Hero Image</strong> - Occupying 50% of the page width, on the left side, while viewing on a desktop. On mobile and tablet devices, the image becomes stacked at the top of the page, occupying 100% of the page width. The imagery used was specifically chosen to visually represent the tonality of the artist's persona.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Banner Container</strong> - Occupying 50% of the width, on the right side, while viewing on a desktop. On mobile and tablet devices, the container becomes stacked, underneath the <strong>Hero Image</strong>. The container provides the biographic information of the artist. It was styled this way in order to draw the users attention to the biography, avoiding information overload in an already text-based area.
          </li>
     </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="listen.html" target="_blank">Listen Now Page</a></dt>
  <dd>The Listen Now page uses a full page <strong>background image</strong>, providing a uniformed and consistent look for aesthetic purposes. The image is a secondary feature of this page, but still accurately representing the look and feel of the website. 
  </dd>
  <dd> A <strong>container</strong> overlays the background image. The purpose of this container is to uniformly represent the necessary information. Within this container there are various <strong>call to action</strong> buttons that link to external music platforms, e.g. Spotify. 
  </dd>


  <dt><a href="live.html" target="_blank">Live Page</a></dt>
  <dd>The Live page uses a similar layout to the Listen Now page, in order to maintain consistency. It uses a full page <strong>background image</strong> to visually represent the tone of the page. 
  </dd>
  <dd> Much like the Listen Now page, a <strong>container</strong> is centered, providing the necessary information to the user, upcoming events in this case. The container has two <strong>call to action</strong> buttons, linking to external websites:
     <ul>
          <li>Venue website for information and directions</li>
          <li>Platform to purchase tickets securely</li>
     </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="epk.html" target="_blank">Electronic Press Kit Page</a></dt>
  <dd> The EPK Page has a full page <strong>static background image</strong> that is fixed and unmoving as the user scrolls through the page. Each section of information is housed in their own individual <strong>container</strong>, separated by a margin gaps. This style was created in order to emphasis the sections, as they appear to the user, on the screen without information overload. 
  </dd>
  <dd>There are several <strong>call to action</strong> buttons throughout the page:
     <ul>
          <li>Link to the external article where the quote is sourced from</li>
          <li>A <strong>mailto</strong> function provides PR contact details for the artist</li>
     </ul>
  </dd>
  <dd>The second to last container hosts two <strong>embedded links</strong> that were chosen to showcase the artist's best releases in both audio and video format:
     <ul>
          <li><strong>Spotify</strong> embedding, showcasing the most played music on Kryan's spotify page</li>
          <li><strong>IGTV</strong> embedding, showcasing his latest music video</li>
     </ul>
  </dd>
  <dd>
  </dd>
</dl>

## Bugs 

### Navbar Bug
A bug was detected early on with the Navigation bar. In implimenting a responsive navigation system, Bootstrap was used but there was bug that would not allow the navbar to be recoloured to suit the the chosen colour scheme. In researching a cause (and solution) the developer found a question posted on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46237610/bootstrap-4-navbar-color-wont-change) with a similar problem. It was from here that the developer was able to copy and edit the code given as a solution on Stack in order to impliment a solution to the bug, with celebratory sucess.

### Home Page Responsiveness Bug
A bug was detected in creating the HomePage where the mobile-first design approach was responsive but as soon as the breakpoint changed to a larger screen, the page layout would shift, creating inconsistentcies in the design. In order to rectify this, the developer utilised a solution posted for a similar problem on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5703552/how-can-i-center-text-horizontally-and-vertically-inside-a-div-block). With this solution, the developer was able to create the desired responsivness without having to use excessive and unnecessary lines of code.

### Hero Image Bug
A bug was detected when implementing the hero image to be used for the Home Page. The developer used the shorthand background element to implement the image but soon found there was an issue with the responsiveness of the image using this. When coding the background-size using the shorthand method, the image would disappear. The developer used an answer to a similar problem on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26236486/background-size-cover-not-working) in order to understand the problem and, in turn, find a solution.

### Social Links Bug
A bug was detected in the Social Links when trying to implement the Bootstrap display property in order to only show the Social links in the toggler menu on smaller devices. In nesting an unordered list within another unordered list, the `padding-inline-start` of the `ul` user agent stylesheet would be set at a value of `40px`. The problem with this was that it was overriding the `d-inline` class that was called. In order to rectify this, the developer had to override the `padding-inline-start` value, using code sourced from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54000514/unordered-list-in-css-will-not-center) with:
```
padding: 0px; 
margin: 0px auto;
```
